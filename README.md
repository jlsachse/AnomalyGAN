# AnomalyGAN

This repository contains PyTorch implementation of the following paper: GANomaly: Semi-Supervised Anomaly Detection via Adversarial Training for [[1]](#reference)

Several experiments with regards to hyperparametertuning, transferability and data representations are conducted. The models are trained with vibration data from CWRU.
